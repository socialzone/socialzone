    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I’m Korishmo, but you can call me Xerox if you prefer something a little more enigmatic. I’m a guy who loves exploring the intersections of technology and art. Whether it's coding a new project or sketching out ideas, creativity is my driving force.</p>
    <p>I’m a passionate and open-minded individual who enjoys deep conversations about everything from the latest tech trends to the nuances of human relationships. I’m also a fan of sci-fi novels, indie music, and the occasional video game binge. Life is a blend of the digital and the tangible for me, and I love finding ways to merge those worlds.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chess:</strong> I play on <a href="https://lichess.org/@/xerox81" target="_blank">Lichess</a></li>
        <li><strong>C++:</strong> Passionate about coding and software development in C++</li>
        <li><strong>Indie Game Development:</strong> Exploring and creating unique indie games</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
    <p>I’m interested in meeting people who share a passion for creativity and exploration, whether it's through art, technology, or unique life experiences. Being open-minded and curious about the world is a big plus. If you enjoy meaningful conversations, spontaneous adventures, and have a bit of a geeky side, we might just get along!</p>
    
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>I’ve got a knack for making the best out of quirky situations and turning them into memorable experiences. Plus, I can often be found in a heated debate about whether the latest sci-fi flick lived up to its hype.</p>
